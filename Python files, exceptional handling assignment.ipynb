What is memory management in Python?\n","* Memory management in Python involves allocating and freeing up memory automatically using garbage collection.\n","* We don’t have to manually manage memory because Python tracks objects and cleans up unused ones.\n","* This helps prevent memory leaks and makes programming easier."],"metadata":{"id":"dRLN7_rrwFKM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","* The basic steps in exception handling are:\n","      1.

Why is memory management important in Python?\n","* Memory management is important because it helps keep our program efficient by freeing up unused memory automatically.\n","* Without it, programs could slow down or crash due to memory leaks.\n","* Python’s management lets us focus on writing code instead of handling memory manually."],"metadata":{"id":"UXf1NLAlwnBt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14.  What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","* The try block contains the code that might raise an exception.\n","* The except block catches and handles the error if one occurs, preventing the program from crashing.\n","* Together, they help us manage errors gracefully and keep the program running smoothly."],"metadata":{"id":"ikZxsgVtww71"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","* Python’s garbage collection automatically frees memory by tracking object references. When an object’s reference count drops to zero, it’s immediately cleaned up. Additionally, Python has a cyclic garbage collector to detect and remove reference cycles that simple counting can’t handle."],"metadata":{"id":"4jF40caDw7YF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","* The else block runs only if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n","* We use it to execute code that should happen when everything goes smoothly, keeping error handling separate."],"metadata":{"id":"3NI3xE4zxE-A"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["17.
